# This Song

[This Song](https://thissong.app/) is a web application providing AI-enhanced analysis of song lyrics. A user can search for and select any song present in the Spotify database, after which the lyrics will be fetched from a third-party provider and then passed through GPT-3.5 for interpretation.

The user can also log in with their Spotify account and gain the ability to analyze the lyrics of the song they're currently playing as well as the songs they've recently played.
