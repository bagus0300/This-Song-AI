# This Song

[This Song](https://thissong.app/) is a web application providing AI-enhanced analysis of song lyrics. A user can search for and select any song, which will be checked against a cloud-hosted database containing descriptions for thousands of songs. If a description cannot be found in the database, the song's lyrics will be passed through a GPT model, providing the user with an instant interpretation and saving the description to the database for later use.

Short summaries of songs' meanings can be viewed at a glace by exploring albums or Spotify playlists.

As soon as Spotify approves the app for production (the estimated timeline is several weeks), the user will also be able to log in in with their Spotify account and gain the ability to analyze the lyrics of the song they're currently playing as well as the songs they've recently played.
